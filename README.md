# Modern-Americana
Final project for Interactive Design I
Modern Americana is an internet-based gallery designed to bring exposure to Artists dedicated to upholding and reinventing American western artwork. The interface allows the audience to view our entire artwork gallery, view selected featured artists that vary based on the month, and offer a section to submit contact information to be featured on the site. Our website is intended for two audiences: People who enjoy American West artwork, but cannot attend the very few temporary galleries hosted throughout the year, and artists looking for exposure for their work that fits in the genre of pieces.
